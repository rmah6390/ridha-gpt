# Ridha-GPT

A small website that answers questions about Ridha Mahmood. It looks and feels like a chat app. It answers all questions about Ridha (skills, projects, experience, contact) and general questions.

Live demo: [https://ridha-gpts.netlify.app/)]

## Why I built this

I wanted a quick way for recruiters and hiring managers to learn about me without digging through documents. This site gives short professional asnswers about me. No buzzwords. No long paragraphs.

## What it does

* Chat UI with a lightweight, clean purple theme
* Answers about Ridha
* Gives short answers by default 
* Never mentions where info came from
* Can also answer general questions (not only about Ridha)
* Includes a contact answer: email and LinkedIn

## How it works (one minute)

* **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind (in frontend/)
* **API:** Netlify Functions (in netlify/functions/)
* **Profile data:** frontend/src/data/resume.json
* **RAG:** The functions embed small chunks of the profile JSON and pull the most relevant lines for a question. The model then writes a short answer in third person.
